# 8. Crimes and Fines

Server rules are meant to be always followed, space law can be broken with some considerations.

    - Capital crimes should be reserved only for antagonists. (AKA pirates, nukies, ect)

    - All other crimes do still need its proper roleplay, justification and escalation to be commited as a non-antagonist.

    - Silicons who are fined or sentenced for a crime they committed then the one responsible for the order is to be charged.

- You must wait at least 20 minutes to loot, salvage, and claim an abandoned shuttle. (from the moment you confirm it is abandoned.) If it the original owner comes back they can claim it as theft(or in some cases Grand Theft) and should be handled according to Space Law.

    - Fines can be stacked up depending on the number of counts of a single crime and the severity. The limit will be defined by the Space Law.
