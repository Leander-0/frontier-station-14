# 8. Crimes and Fines

Server rules are meant to be always followed, space law can be broken with some considerations.

    - Capital crimes should be reserved only for antagonists. (AKA pirates, nukies, ect)

    - All other crimes do still need its proper roleplay, justification and escalation to be commited as a non-antagonist.

    - If a cyborg/AI commits a crime and requires to be senteced or fined then their responsible would be charged.

    - You must wait at least 20 minutes to loot, salvage and claim an abandoned shuttle. (from the moment you confirm it is abandoned.)

    - If the ship was taken and the original owner comes back they can claim it as an stolen vessel and the people that took said ship can be charged with theft up to grand theft depending on the vesssel.

    - Fines can be stacked up depending on the number of counts of a single crime and the severity. The limit will be defined by the Space Law.
