# 2. In-context Info

Keep everything on the place it belongs, it hurts the roleplay when your character starts talking about stuff they should not know.

## 2.1 Meta

  - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means, and do not say In Character (IC) things in the Local Out Of Character (LOOC) chat channel.

  - Do not say LOOC things in IC either, like saying you “need to go afk because your dog wants to go outside,” in the IC chat.

	- Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.

## 2.2 Cloning and revival

  - After cloning, respawning, or taking a ghost role, you must follow the new life rule.

  - If cloned, resuscitated, or respawned, you don't have amnesia, but you can only recall vague details of who or what had killed you.

  - Do not respawn to avoid punishment from the NFSD, or respawn as the same character if given a permanent confinement sentence or execution.

  - If taking a ghost role, you have no memories from any past lives for the duration of playing as a ghost role.

  - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.
