# 1. Community Expectations

Everyone here is playing to have a good time and have fun, respect the rest of the players around you the same way you would like to be respected.

    - Follow the community expectations. This includes both in game and elsewhere in our community.

    - Don't be a dick nor harass other players.

    - Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and SSD/Catatonic Players.

    - Do not respawn to avoid punishment from the NFSD, or respawn as the same character if given a permanent confinement sentence or execution.

    - Do not push political messages of any kind in chat, images, drawings or faxes.
