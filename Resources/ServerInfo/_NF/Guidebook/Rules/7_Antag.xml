# 7. Antagonist and PvP Guidelines

Even the evil guys follow their own rules.

    ## PvP

    - All ghost roles have a set description for how the role should be played, you must follow the ghost role description unless told otherwise by an admin. Spamming ahelp asking for an exception will likely lead to being banned.

    - Antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and sometimes wizards are free agents, but no one should be working together with hostiles like xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, space dragons, zombies or pirates.

    - Non-hostile vessels that surrender: cannot be killed, left stranded, completely bankrupt, or otherwise. The safety of non-hostile merchant vessels is to be guaranteed by all parties.

    - All vessels being boarded must first attempt to negotiate before any hostile actions may take place.

    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, may be considered 'belligerent', boarded non-conventionally, and have their systems disabled in attempts to bring them to justice.

    - All suspects taken alive must be adequately cared for and unharmed according to Space Law.

    # Antagonists and piracy

    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain, sentient pets and cyborgs.

    - As a pirate you must have LOOC permission before kidnapping and holding any civilian hostage. (people kept hostage cannot be forced to do labor under any circumstance)

    - Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews, examples are such as watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack, pretending to be hostages, or knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.

    - Non-pirates can not be hired, pretend, be coerced or forced to work as pirates or become one.
